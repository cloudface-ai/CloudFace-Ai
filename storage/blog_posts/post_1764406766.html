<p>Face-based AI tools are powerful, but only when they’re built on trust. At CloudFace AI, privacy isn’t a feature—it’s the foundation. Every layer of our system is designed so your face data remains <em>your</em> data.</p><p>A face is not just an image. It’s identity. That’s why CloudFace AI uses banking-grade security practices to protect it from the moment you upload.</p><h2>What Actually Happens to Your Face When You Use CloudFace AI</h2><h3><strong>1. Your Raw Images Are Never Stored</strong></h3><p>The moment you upload an image, it is processed inside a secure, isolated environment.</p><p> Once the output is generated, the original file is deleted automatically.</p><p>This means:</p><ul><li>No long-term storage</li><li>No internal reuse</li><li>No secret datasets</li><li>No risk of future access</li></ul><p>Your photo comes in, gets processed, and vanishes—every time.</p><h2><strong>2. Encrypted End-to-End (AES-256 + HTTPS/TLS 1.3)</strong></h2><p>Every step between your device and our servers is encrypted with state-of-the-art standards:</p><ul><li><strong>TLS 1.3</strong> for secure communication</li><li><strong>AES-256 encryption</strong> for data at rest and in memory</li><li><strong>Container-isolated processing</strong> to prevent user-to-user data leakage</li></ul><p>This is the same protection used in modern financial systems.</p><h2><strong>3. Zero Human Access Policy</strong></h2><p>No team member at CloudFace AI can view, download, or manually access user face data.</p><p>Internal safeguards block:</p><ul><li>Admin-level access</li><li>Manual intervention</li><li>Screenshot attempts</li><li>Log-level data exposure</li></ul><p>Your data stays invisible—literally.</p><h2><strong>4. Automatic Deletion After Processing</strong></h2><p>Once your output is delivered, the deletion sequence permanently clears:</p><ul><li>The uploaded image</li><li>Temporary AI embeddings</li><li>Cache files</li><li>Processing logs</li></ul><p>This process is irreversible. Nothing is retained.</p><h2><strong>5. No Training on Your Photos</strong></h2><p>CloudFace AI <strong>does NOT</strong> use any uploaded images to train or improve AI models.</p><p>We do not:</p><ul><li>Create facial profiles</li><li>Store biometric signatures</li><li>Use your photos in datasets</li><li>Track patterns, expressions, or identity</li></ul><p>Your images serve only one purpose: generating your requested output.</p><h2><strong>6. GDPR, CCPA &amp; India DPDP Compliant by Design</strong></h2><p>Our system aligns with the strictest privacy frameworks worldwide:</p><ul><li><strong>GDPR (EU)</strong></li><li><strong>CCPA (California)</strong></li><li><strong>DPDP Act (India)</strong></li></ul><p>We follow principles like:</p><ul><li>Data minimization</li><li>Explicit consent</li><li>Right to delete</li><li>Purpose limitation</li></ul><p>Even if your region doesn’t legally demand these protections, we provide them.</p><h2><strong>7. Secure AWS Infrastructure</strong></h2><p>CloudFace AI runs on hardened AWS architecture, including:</p><ul><li>Encrypted S3 buckets (temporary storage only)</li><li>VPC-isolated compute nodes</li><li>Strict IAM permissions</li><li>Automated security patches</li><li>Continuous threat monitoring</li></ul><p>Your data stays inside a locked, monitored environment.</p><h1>In Simple Words: Your Face Stays Yours</h1><p>CloudFace AI never stores your images, never trains on them, and never allows human access.</p><p> Your data passes through a secure, fully encrypted pipeline, produces your output, and is destroyed.</p><p>You get the results—nothing else remains.</p>
